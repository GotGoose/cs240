Introduction</A>
</H1>
You may have become very familiar with popular commercial email
clients, such as Outlook Express or Mozilla. Most of these supply
powerful user-friendly address book tools to manage the long list
of contact information. Do you want to design your own address
book to manipulate your friend list? It's worth a try!

<P>
In this project, your task is to implement an address book search
program that can read a comma-delimited text file. Users can
perform keyword searching and displaying functions on the imported
address book, for example, "Search the address book for Tom in
Name".

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Background</A>
</H1>
Some address-book facility in general-purpose Email Clients, such
as Netscape Communicator or Outlook Express, can export the
address book to a comma or tab-delimited text file. In this
project, we will use comma-delimited records as the initial input.
Download the sample text file containing comma-delimited data from the following
link to your working directory. 
<BR>
<P>

<P>
<BR>

<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="sample.txt">Sample Input File</A>
<P>
<BR>

<P>
Each entry in the personal contact information record is
ordered in the following way:

<P>
noindent <B>Name,Telephone,Address,City,State,ZIP code,Email</B>

<P>
For example: Tom Green,(765)496-1234,200 State
Street,West Lafayette,IN,47906,tom@@purdue.edu

<P>
which means:

<P>
Name: Tom Green 
<BR>
Telephone:(765)496-1234 
<BR>
Address: 200 State Street
<BR>
City: West Lafayette
<BR>
State: IN 
<BR>
Zip code: 47906

Project Details</A>
</H1>
Your program needs to perform the following:

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
Reading and Parsing the comma-delimited data</A>
</H2>

<P>
You program should read the comma-delimited records from STDIN and
build up the initial database. An empty line indicates the end of initial input.

<P>
We will always test your program by feeding it a comma-delimited file containing  an initial set of addresses using input redirection,
i.e., <TT>AddrBook &lt; address.txt</TT>.You can assume that the input file always has a valid format and
contains at least one entry and <B>at most</B> 100 entries. You
also have to allow for the possibility that a record may contain
some empty fields. For example, in record

<P>
"Tom Green,(765)496-1234,,,IN,47906,tom@purdue.edu",

<P>
the Address and City fields are empty. The only
exception is the Name field, which functions as the primary key,
and hence cannot be empty. Thus, you can assume that the Name
field is always unique and never empty, while other fields can be repetitive or empty.

<P>

 <B>Hint: You will probably
need to interpret and store the data in multiple arrays, with each
array containing one field.</B>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
User input</A>
</H2>
You have to remove extra spaces from user input and store each field
in the standard form stated as follows: 
<BR>
<P>
We define a word with no
space as a unit of a field. For example, the Address field "123
Nimitz Drive" has three units: "123","Nimitz" and "Drive". There
should be no spaces before the first unit or after the last unit.
And there is one and only one space to separate two units. For
example, if user inputs the Name field as "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", you
have to change it to "Tom Green" and store it in your own data
structures.

Functionality</A>
</H2>
Your project interface must include the following functionality:
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Search Record</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Search for a record based on the user-specified field</TD>

<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Delete Record</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Delete a record in the address book</TD>

alphabetical order of names</TD>

Search Record</A>
</H3>

<OL>
<LI><I>Keywords for searching records should be  case insensitive</I>.
The following names should all match when you search for Tom Green:

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Tom Green 
<BR>
Tom green 
<BR>
tom green

<P>
<BR>

</LI>
<LI><I>Queries should yield partial matches</I>. That is,
you will locate records with the specified field containing the
substrings, separated by white spaces, submitted by users. For
example, if the search is for "Tom Green" in the NAME field, your
program should print out all records for which the NAME field
contains Tom and Green, such as "Tom Greenwood", "Tommy Greenland"
and "Tommy Green".
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00033200000000000000">
Insert/Delete Record</A>
</H3>
Record insertion is performed based on the Name field. Only if the
specified Name <I>does not already exist</I> in the database will
the other fields be collected and inserted. Record deletion is
based on an <B>exact match</B> of a given name. For example, if
the given name is "Tom", only records with <I>exact</I> name "Tom"
can be deleted, while "Tom Green" or "Tommy Lee" are not exact
matches and cannot be deleted. As stated earlier, keywords for
searching records should be <I>case insensitive</I>.

<P>
<B>Hint: You may use another integer/boolean array
to flag whether each entry in the address book is valid or
invalid. In this way, deleting a record becomes simple: you only
need to reset a value to 0.</B>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00033300000000000000">
Review all records</A>
</H3>
The review-all command will enable the grader to ensure if the
insertion and deletion of records is being done correctly. Because
the output should be in alphabetical order of Name(also <I>case insensitive</I>), you will need
to write a <TT>sort</TT> function. In this project, you are allowed
to use any sorting algorithm. For example, the
<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble
sort</A>
is a simple
sorting algorithm.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00033400000000000000">
Quit</A>
</H3>
 A session will end if the menu choice corresponding to <TT>quit</TT>
is entered, or the key sequence Ctrl-D is entered.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00033500000000000000">
Interface</A>
</H3>
After your program reads in the initial database, it should
present the menu on the console. The user can enter his/her input
to specify which of the program functions is to be performed.
Please look at the sample output:
<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="output.txt">output</A>
for details.

Note and Restrictions</A>
</H1>


<OL>

<LI><P>In this project, we would like you to use a better program structure than before. In previous labs/projects, you only needed to write one .c file. But sometimes you may need multiple .c and/or .h files to organize your program more efficiently. For example, in this project, you are not allowed to use any library function in <B>string.h</B>. That is to say, you have to write your own string functions to compare strings, copy strings and do other string manipulation. You can write all the string functions in a source file named mystring.c. And if you want to call those functions in your main .c file, which implements, for example, the user interface, you also need to write a corresponding .h file and include it in your main .c file. In addition, you can also use static/extern to let your functions be used locally/globally. 
</P></LI>
<LI>You are only allowed to use <TT>getchar</TT> or <TT>gets</TT>
to read from STDIN and <TT>printf</TT> to output to STDOUT. Any
other use of another library function will result in an automatic
zero. No exceptions.

<P>
</LI> 

<P>
 
<LI>You can define limit constants as follows:
<BR>
<P>
#define MAX_CONTACT 100 // maximum number of contacts 
<BR>#define MAX_FIELDLEN 50 // maximum length of a field string 
<BR>#define MAX_LINELEN 250 // maimum length of a user-input line 
<BR>
</P>
<LI><P>
You can use #ifdef DEBUG to print out more information to help you debug your program. 
</P>
</LI>
<LI>If a project fails to compile based either on syntax errors or Makefile errors (omission constitutes error), your project will receive an automatic zero.
