Nothing matters It¡¯s all gone I¡¯m empty and she doesn¡¯t care It doesn¡¯t matter How I feel or what I say She¡¯s far away And wouldn¡¯t stay No matter what I say It wouldn¡¯t matter anyway I used to wait for the day Just to hear her say I miss you Guess I was the biggest fool Didn¡¯t want to think you were cruel I¡¯m alone now and broken Left without even one token Of love or caring It all died on my birthday How could I be so daring?
