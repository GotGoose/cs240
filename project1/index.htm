<h1 align="center">Simple Text Analyzer</h1>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#FF0000">Due Date: Monday 02/01/2010 11:59PM</font></b></p>
<p align="center">  </p>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>In this project, we'd like you to implement a small application which can do 
simple analysis and operations over a given text.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h2>Task:</h2>
<p>After your program is executed, a menu should be prompted, which indicates 
the operations that can be done by the analyzer:</p>
<p><b><font color="#008000">1. Input Text<br>
2. Text Stats<br>
3. Find Substring<br>
4. Reverse Text<br>
5. Quit</font></b></p>
<p>User can enter '1'-'5' followed by a new line character. Other input should be 
considered as invalid and your program should output &quot;Invalid Input&quot;. (eg. 6, 
10, a,...)</p>
<p><b>Input Text</b></p>
<p>User can input text no more than 1000 characters. After the new text is 
entered, it overwrites the old one. The default text should be an empty string. 
Notice that the text doesn't include the last new line character. If the user 
enters more than 1000 characters, print out the warning message and let the user 
enter again.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>Text Stats</b></p>
<p>The program outputs the statistical information about the text entered.</p>
<p>The information includes:</p>
<p><b><i>Character Number: </i></b>The length of the text.</p>
<p><b><i>Word Number:</i></b> The number of words in the text. In this case, a 
word only consists of alphabet (a-z,A-Z). So the string &quot;<b><font color="#008000">it's</font></b>&quot; 
has two words (&quot;it&quot; and &quot;s&quot;), &quot;<b><font color="#008000">4.5</font></b>&quot; contains 
0 word.</p>
<p><b><i>Sentence Number:</i></b> The number of sentences in the text. The 
sentence is defined by '.' or '!' or '?' followed by ' ' or '\0' or ''' or '&quot;'. 
So the string &quot;hello world&quot; contains 0 sentence while &quot;hello. World!&quot; contains 2 
sentences.</p>
<p><b><i>Most Frequent Characters: </i></b>Three most frequent characters in the 
text. The program should output the characters and their frequencies in 
descending order. However, sometimes the number of output characters will be 
less than 3 or more than 3. For the string &quot;<b><font color="#008000">aaaabb</font></b>&quot;, 
there're only 2 different characters. In this case, just output 'a':4&nbsp; 
'b':2.&nbsp; For the string &quot;<b><font color="#008000">ffffddccabb</font></b>&quot;, 
all 'b' 'c' 'd' have the same frequency of 2. In this case, output 'f':4&nbsp; 
'b':2&nbsp; 'c':2&nbsp; 'd':2. If characters have the same frequency, output 
them in ascending order by ASCII value.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>Find Substring</b></p>
<p>After user selects this option, he will input a substring no more than 1000 
characters. Then program outputs the times the substring occurs in the original 
text. For example, if the text is &quot;<b><font color="#008000">howdoyoudo?</font></b>&quot; 
and the substring is &quot;<b><font color="#008000">do</font></b>&quot;, there're 2 
occurrences. Overlapping should be taken into account. For example, if the text 
is &quot;<b><font color="#008000">aaaabbaa</font></b>&quot; and the substring is &quot;<b><font color="#008000">aa</font></b>&quot;, 
the occurrence time should be 4 instead of 3.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>Reverse Text</b></p>
<p>Reverse the word in the text. In this case, a word is regarded as continuous 
characters without ' ' and '\t' in it. So &quot;<b><font color="#008000">it's</font></b>&quot; 
is one word, &quot;<b><font color="#008000">http:www.purdue.edu</font></b>&quot; is also 
one word. If the original text is &quot;<b><font color="#008000">&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm 
here, mom</font></b>&quot;, the resulting text should be &quot;<b><font color="#008000">mom 
here, i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></b>&quot;.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h2>Test Cases:</h2>
<p><i>(The black is the user input and the blue is the program output)</i></p>
<p><i>(Please don't copy the input from the web page directly because html can't 
display some special characters. Instead, download the input files and use 
redirection.)</i></p>

The Big Bang is the leading theory that almost all astrophysicists believe 
explains the origin of the universe. This is because all observations so far 
made support the Big Bang theory; there are four main lines of evidence that are 
most-often used. The first was discussed above: The expansion of the universe. 
The universe is expanding now, so in the past it must have been smaller. If it 
were smaller in the past, then there probably was a time when it was 
infinitesimally small. One could ask why don't we think that it might be 
expanding now but it could have been shrinking before and we just don't know 
about it. The answer is that there is simply no mechanism that we know about 
that could accomplish this transition on a universal scale. The second line of 
evidence is the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) that was discovered 
in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson from Bell Labs. They were working with 
a microwave receiver used to communicate with the Telstar satellite, but were 
getting noise from every direction they pointed the receiver. It was coming from 
all over the sky at what seemed to be exactly the same frequency. This was the 
first evidence for the CMB, and they later shared a Nobel Prize for this 
discovery. The CMB is an &quot;echo&quot; left over from when the universe was 
approximately 300,000 years old, as predicted by the Big Bang model. As 
something becomes compressed, as matter was when the universe was young, it 
becomes hot. The actual &quot;heat&quot; comes from particles' movements - the faster they 
move, the more energetic they are, and so the more heat we see. The universe was 
so hot before it was 300,000 years old that atoms could not form. Because of 
this, photons - particles of light - could not move around, for they kept 
reacting with electrons - the negatively charged parts of atoms. Therefore, 
during this period, the universe was effectively opaque. Once the universe had 
reached 300,000 years old, atoms could form, and electrons were now bound to a 
nucleus. Once this happened, photons could move about freely. This &quot;first light&quot; 
is the CMB, and its existence is a very strong indication that the Big Bang 
occurred. The third major pillar of the Big Bang theory lies in the abundance of 
the different elements of the universe. The theory predicts that certain amounts 
of hydrogen (~72%), helium (~28%), and other elements should be made. 
Observations have shown almost exactly the amounts that are predicted. The 
fourth piece is that the Big Bang theory is the only one that comprehensively 
lays down a framework for the eventual evolution of the universe as we observe 
it today. </b></p>

<a href="output.zip">output</a> files. Use input/output redirection to test your 
program.</p>
<p>Passing all the test cases above doesn't imply your program is 100% correct 
so that you should get full mark. Different test cases will be used for grading. 
You can also design your own test cases.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>1. To find substrings, you can use the library function &quot;strncmp()&quot;. Check 
the manual for detail.</p>
<p>2. To reverse the text in word, you can first reverse the whole string in 
characters, then reverse each word in characters.</p>
